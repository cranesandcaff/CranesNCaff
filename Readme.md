## A Work in Progress

Currently utilizing AngularJS, ExpressJS on top of MongoDB and NodeJS. Plans to add Prerender.io in order to allow SEO of AJAX content. Was using Bootstrap which you'll find a lot of remnants of within files, swapped over to Bourbon with Bitters and Neat.

Side note, if you put bitters in your bourbon doesn't that make it no longer neat?
